## 2022-03-31

Release v1.2.0.

+ Enhancement & New Features
  + Provide a new CR `PolarDBXMonitor` for declaring the monitoring of some `PolarDBXCluster`. The controller will create `ServiceMonitors` to make prometheus scraping the metrics.
  + Provide a new chart `polardbx-monitor` which packages a customized [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) release with predefined dashboards for monitoring PolarDB-X clusters.
  + Provide support for xpaxos version of [galaxyengine](https://github.com/ApsaraDB/galaxyengine). Now the `PolarDBXCluster` controller will create a typical paxos cluster (leader + follower + logger) for each GMS and DN by default. 
    + **Note** this is a breaking change. After the upgrade, the old `XStores` will be in an unmaintainable state. Update of the GMS/DN is not possible due to incompatible data/log formats. You may have to delete all the `PolarDBXCluster` in your Kubernetes before/after the upgrade.
    + If you want to keep the compatibility, you can disable this feature by declaring feature gate with negative symbol `EnableGalaxyCluster-`. After that, no multi-node `XStore` with galaxy engine can be created.
  + Support scaling up/down and self-healing of the `XStores`.

+ Bug Fix
  + Fix the behavior of polardbx-exporter when part of the scrape tasks fail.
